# Surfs Up Weather Analysis
## Project Overview
To review weather patterns in Hawaii to inform the investment decision on opening a surf and ice cream shop. We focused on the temperature in June and December,  to help assess whether an ice cream and surf shop be succesfful based on the weather.

## Results
The following tables summarize the June data:

The following table summarizes the Decembers data:

![December Temperature Statistics](https://github.com/msc2488/surfs_up/blob/main/Dec%20Temperature%20Stats.PNG)

These two tables tell us about the weather patterns during June and December with the following takeaways:
1) Average temperature in June and December are 75 and 71 degrees respectively, showing little fluctuation between the two periods on an average basis
2) The maximum temperatures of 85 in June and 83 December are also very similiar and show little fluctuation
3) The minimum temperature shows the greatest variation with June having a low of 64 and December 56, suggesting that December might be too cold for the ice cream and surf shop.

## Summary
Historically, the weather in December and June are very similar but we note that the weather in December has been historically less predictable.  

Additional queries to help inform the investment decision include:
Determine the difference in precipation between June and December to determine if one has more rain
Compare data by weather station, as the results are likely influenced by the location of the station, particurlary the elevation
